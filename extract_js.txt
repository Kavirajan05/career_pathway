INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE script.js
=================================

Since the JavaScript code is very large, follow these steps to extract it from your original HTML:

METHOD 1: Manual Extraction (Recommended)
------------------------------------------
1. Open your original HTML file in a text editor
2. Search for "<script>" near the end of the file (before </body>)
3. Select and copy EVERYTHING between <script> and </script> (do NOT include the tags)
4. Create a new file named "script.js" in the same folder as index.html
5. Paste the copied JavaScript code into script.js
6. Save the file

Your script.js should start with these lines:
```
// Global variables
let currentUser = null;
let currentDomain = null;
let currentQuestionIndex = 0;
```

And end with these lines:
```
// Initialize the application
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    showLanding();
});
```

METHOD 2: Using Command Line (Windows PowerShell)
--------------------------------------------------
If you have the original HTML as a single file, you can extract it using a text editor's "Find and Replace" feature:

1. Open the original HTML in VS Code or Notepad++
2. Find the <script> tag content
3. Copy to new file named script.js

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- Do NOT include the opening <script> tag
- Do NOT include the closing </script> tag
- Do NOT include the Cloudflare script at the very end
- ONLY include the main application JavaScript code

FILE SIZE:
----------
The script.js file should be approximately 100-150 KB in size and contain around 3000+ lines of JavaScript code including:
- Global variables
- Question database with all domains
- Navigation functions
- Quiz logic
- Results analysis
- Chatbot functionality
- All event handlers

VERIFICATION:
-------------
After creating script.js, open index.html in a browser. If you see:
✅ "Prodigy Pathways" landing page with animations
✅ Login and Register buttons work
✅ Forms submit without errors

Then your separation was successful!

If you see errors in the browser console, double-check that:
- script.js is in the same directory as index.html
- The <script src="script.js"></script> line is at the bottom of index.html (before </body>)
- No syntax errors were introduced during copy/paste
